        <h3>Definition list</h3>
        <p>The <code>dl</code> element is for another type of list called a definition list. Instead of list items, the content of a <code>dl</code> consists of <code>dt</code> (Definition Term) and <code>dd</code> (Definition description) pairs. Though it may be called a &#8220;definition list&#8221;, <code>dl</code> can apply to other scenarios where a parent/child relationship is applicable. For example, it may be used for marking up dialogues, with each <code>dt</code> naming a speaker, and each <code>dd</code> containing his or her words.</p>
        <div class="example">
          <dl>
            <dt>This is a term.</dt>
            <dd>This is the definition of that term, which both live in a <code>dl</code>.</dd>
            <dt>Here is another term.</dt>
            <dd>And it gets a definition too, which is this line.</dd>
            <dt>Here is term that shares a definition with the term below.</dt>
            <dt>Here is a defined term.</dt>
            <dd><code>dt</code> terms may stand on their own without an accompanying <code>dd</code>, but in that case they <em>share</em> descriptions with the next available <code>dt</code>. You may not have a <code>dd</code> without a parent <code>dt</code>.</dd>
          </dl>
        </div>

        <h3>Figures</h3>
        <p>Figures are usually used to refer to images:</p>
        <div class="example">
          <figure>
            <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="Example image"/>
            <figcaption>
              This is a placeholder image, with supporting caption.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>
        <p>Here, a part of a poem is marked up using figure:</p>
        <div class="example">
          <figure>
            <p>&#8216;Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br/>
            Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;<br/>
            All mimsy were the borogoves,<br/>
            And the mome raths outgrabe.</p>

            </figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>
        <p>When you  wish to cite the source of a quote, you should do so using a figure also:</p>
        <div class="example">
          <blockquote cite="http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1947/nov/11/parliament-bill#column_206">
            <p>Many forms of Government have been tried, and will be tried in this world of sin and woe. No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise. Indeed, it has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.</p>

        <h2 id="text">Text-level Semantics</h2>
        <p>There are a number of inline <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> elements you may use anywhere within other elements.</p>

        <h3>Links and anchors</h3>
        <p>The <code>a</code> element is used to hyperlink text, be that to another page, a named fragment on the current page or any other location on the web. Example:</p>
        <div class="example">
          <p><a href="/">Go to the home page</a> or <a href="#banner">return to the top of this page</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Stressed emphasis</h3>
        <p>The <code>em</code> element is used to denote text with stressed emphasis, i.e., something you&#8217;d pronounce differently. Where italicizing is required for stylistic differentiation, the <code>i</code> element may be preferable. Example:</p>
        <div class="example">
          <p>You simply <em>must</em> try the negitoro maki!</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Strong importance</h3>
        <p>The <code>strong</code> element is used to denote text with strong importance. Where bolding is used for stylistic differentiation, the <code>b</code> element may be preferable. Example:</p> 
        <div class="example">
          <p><strong>Don&#8217;t</strong> stick nails in the electrical outlet.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Small print</h3>
        <p>The <small>small</small> element is used to represent disclaimers, caveats, legal restrictions, or copyrights (commonly referred to as &#8216;small print&#8217;). It can also be used for attributions or satisfying licensing requirements. Example:</p>
        <div class="example">
          <p><small>Copyright &#169; 1922-2011 Acme Corporation. All Rights Reserved.</small></p>
        </div>

        <h3>Strikethrough</h3>
        <p>The <code>s</code> element is used to represent content that is no longer accurate or relevant. When indicating document edits i.e., marking a span of text as having been removed from a document, use the <code>del</code> element instead. Example:</p>
        <div class="example">
          <p><s>Recommended retail price: &#163;3.99 per bottle</s><br/><strong>Now selling for just &#163;2.99 a bottle!</strong></p>
        </div>

        <h3>Citations</h3>
        <p>The <code>cite</code> element is used to represent the title of a work (e.g. a book, essay, poem, song, film, TV show, sculpture, painting, musical, exhibition, etc). This can be a work that is being quoted or referenced in detail (i.e. a citation), or it can just be a work that is mentioned in passing. Example:</p>
        <div class="example">
          <p><cite>Universal Declaration of Human Rights</cite>, United Nations, December 1948. Adopted by General Assembly resolution 217 A (III).</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Inline quotes</h3>
        <p>The <code>q</code> element is used for quoting text inline. Example showing nested quotations:</p>
        <div class="example">
          <p>John said, <q>I saw Lucy at lunch, she told me <q>Mary wants you to get some ice cream on your way home</q>. I think I will get some at Ben and Jerry&#8217;s, on Gloucester Road.</q></p>
        </div>

        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>The <code>dfn</code> element is used to highlight the first use of a term. The <code>title</code> attribute can be used to describe the term. Example:</p>
        <div class="example">
          <p>Bob&#8217;s <dfn title="Dog">canine</dfn> mother and <dfn title="Horse">equine</dfn> father sat him down and carefully explained that he was an <dfn title="A mutation that combines two or more sets of chromosomes from different species">allopolyploid</dfn> organism.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Abbreviation</h3>
        <p>The <code>abbr</code> element is used for any abbreviated text, whether it be acronym, initialism, or otherwise. Generally, it&#8217;s less work and useful (enough) to mark up only the first occurrence of any particular abbreviation on a page, and ignore the rest. Any text in the <code>title</code> attribute will appear when the user&#8217;s mouse hovers the abbreviation (although notably, this does not work in Internet Explorer for Windows). Example abbreviations:</p>
        <div class="example">
          <p><abbr title="British Broadcasting Corportation">BBC</abbr>, <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, and <abbr title="Staffordshire">Staffs.</abbr></p>
        </div>

        <h3>Time</h3>
        <p>The <code>time</code> element is used to represent either a time on a 24 hour clock, or a precise date in the proleptic Gregorian calendar, optionally with a time and a time-zone offset. Example:</p>
        <div class="example">
          <p>Queen Elizabeth II was proclaimed sovereign of each of the Commonwealth realms on <time datetime="1952-02-6">6</time> and <time datetime="1952-02-7">7 February 1952</time>, after the death of her father, King George VI.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Code</h3>
        <p>The <code>code</code> element is used to represent fragments of computer code. Useful for technology-oriented sites, not so useful otherwise. Example:</p>
        <div class="example">
          <p>When you call the <code>activate()</code> method on the <code>robotSnowman</code> object, the eyes glow.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Used in conjunction with the <code>pre</code> element:</p>
        <div class="example">
  <pre><code>function getJelly() {
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;echo $aDeliciousSnack;
  }</code></pre>
        </div>

        <h3>Variable</h3>
        <p>The <code>var</code> element is used to denote a variable in a mathematical expression or programming context, but can also be used to indicate a placeholder where the contents should be replaced with your own value. Example:</p>
        <div class="example">
          <p>If there are <var>n</var> pipes leading to the ice cream factory then I expect at <em>least</em> <var>n</var> flavours of ice cream to be available for purchase!</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Sample output</h3>
        <p>The <code>samp</code> element is used to represent (sample) output from a program or computing system. Useful for technology-oriented sites, not so useful otherwise. Example:</p>
        <div class="example">
          <p>The computer said <samp>Too much cheese in tray two</samp> but I didn&#8217;t know what that meant.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Keyboard entry</h3>
        <p>The <code>kbd</code> element is used to denote user input (typically via a keyboard, although it may also be used to represent other input methods, such as voice commands). Example:<p>
        <div class="example">
          <p>To take a screenshot on your Mac, press <kbd>&#8984; Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>&#8679; Shift</kbd> + <kbd>3</kbd>.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Superscript and subscript text</h3>
        <p>The <code>sup</code> element represents a superscript and the sub element represents a <code>sub</code>. These elements must be used only to mark up typographical conventions with specific meanings, not for typographical presentation. As a guide, only use these elements if their absence would change the meaning of the content. Example:</p>
        <div class="example">
          <p>The coordinate of the <var>i</var>th point is (<var>x<sub><var>i</var></sub></var>, <var>y<sub><var>i</var></sub></var>). For example, the 10th point has coordinate (<var>x<sub>10</sub></var>, <var>y<sub>10</sub></var>).</p>
          <p>f(<var>x</var>, <var>n</var>) = log<sub>4</sub><var>x</var><sup><var>n</var></sup></p>
        </div>

        <h3>Italicised</h3>
        <p>The <code>i</code> element is used for text in an alternate voice or mood, or otherwise offset from the normal prose. Examples include taxonomic designations, technical terms, idiomatic phrases from another language, the name of a ship or other spans of text whose typographic presentation is typically italicised. Example:</p>
        <div class="example">
          <p>There is a certain <i lang="fr">je ne sais quoi</i> in the air.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Emboldened</h3>
        <p>The <code>b</code> element is used for text stylistically offset from normal prose without conveying extra importance, such as key words in a document abstract, product names in a review, or other spans of text whose typographic presentation is typically emboldened. Example:</p>
        <div class="example">
          <p>You enter a small room. Your <b>sword</b> glows brighter. A <b>rat</b> scurries past the corner wall.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Marked or highlighted text</h3>
        <p>The <code>mark</code> element is used to represent a run of text marked or highlighted for reference purposes. When used in a quotation it indicates a highlight not originally present but added to bring the reader&#8217;s attention to that part of the text. When used in the main prose of a document, it indicates a part of the document that has been highlighted due to its relevance to the user&#8217;s current activity. Example:</p>
        <div class="example">
          <p>I also have some <mark>kitten</mark>s who are visiting me these days. They&#8217;re really cute. I think they like my garden! Maybe I should adopt a <mark>kitten</mark>.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 id="edits">Edits</h3>
        <p>The <code>del</code> element is used to represent deleted or retracted text which still must remain on the page for some reason. Meanwhile its counterpart, the <code>ins</code> element, is used to represent inserted text. Both <code>del</code> and <code>ins</code> have a <code>datetime</code> attribute which allows you to include a timestamp directly in the element. Example inserted text and usage:</p>
        <div class="example">
          <p>She bought <del datetime="2005-05-30T13:00:00">two</del> <ins datetime="2005-05-30T13:00:00">five</ins> pairs of shoes.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="tables">Tabular data</h2>
        <p>Tables should be used when displaying tabular data. The <code>thead</code>, <code>tfoot</code> and <code>tbody</code> elements enable you to group rows within each a table.</p>
        <p>If you use these elements, you must use every element. They should appear in this order: <code>thead</code>, <code>tfoot</code> and <code>tbody</code>, so that browsers can render the foot before receiving all the data. You must use these tags within the table element.</p>
        <div class="example">
