style-guide
===========

Canonical source of markup patterns and css

The style-guide is a [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) application, with [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) workflow to generate assets.


## Requirements

* [Node](http://nodejs.org/)

You may already have it, try:

```
node --version
```

Your version needs to be at least v0.10.0.

* Grunt

Make sure you've installed the Grunt command line interface --- see http://gruntjs.com/getting-started

* The Sass ruby gem

You probably already have Ruby installed, try

```
ruby -v
```

When you've confirmed you have Ruby installed, run ```gem install sass``` to install Sass.

## Getting started

* Clone this repo.

* If you don't have Node, download and install it from here: [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).

* Ensure you’ve cd’ed into the style-guide folder, then ```npm install``` to install dependencies.
